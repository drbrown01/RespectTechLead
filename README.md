# RespectTechLead
Todays lessons that I intend to use!


1. Respect the Tech Lead. This is immutable!
2. I will use design documents as much as possible to document what I
  intend to do.
3. I will use small diffs or commits and document their purpose, intent or idea clearly.
4. I will focus on keeping my Actions per minute in line with my goals.
5. I will be receptive to direction and comments. I will never be arrogant or disregard the potential of information offered.
6. I will always seek help before being non-productive. If you are considering working with me, please know that I will be trying to communicate... alot :) !
